Static keyword in C++
Author: Daniel

The **Static** keyword in C++ is used to give special characteristics to an element.
Static elements are forced to allocate storage only once in a program lifetime in storage. They have a scope the entire program lifetime.
Here are the types of Static keyword use-cases:

1. Static Variables in a Func.
	These are different because they are stored in a static storage, meaning that it gets allocated for the lifetime of the program and not in the stack.
Memory is Allocated once.
If the function that holds it is called multiple times, space is only allocated once and the value of the variable from the previous call is carried through the next function calls.

1. Static Variables in a Class
	The static variables in a class are shared by the objects.
There can't not be multiple copies of same static variables for different objects.
