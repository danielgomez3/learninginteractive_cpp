'Singleton' Design pattern
Author: Daniel Gomez
~~~~~~~

**Singleton** is a design pattern and principle that is used to make sure we instantiate a class in one object.  
There are some pros and cons to weigh. 
Uses:
	* Useful when exactly one object is needed across the entire system
	* It is very convenient to implement
Weakness:
	* Sometimes to have only one instance of a class is not your goal.
	* By choosing convenience, you sacrifice transparency, meaning you might loose track of what you're doing.
	* By making something accessible to everyone, it becomes potentially dangerous because that would make sensitive data more open to throughout your program creating vulnerabilities.
