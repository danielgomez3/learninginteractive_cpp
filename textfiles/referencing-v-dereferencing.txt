REFERENCING VS. DEREFERENCING
~~~~~~~~~
Reference operator: '&' (ampersand)
Dereference operator: '*' (asterisk)

**Referencing** means to take the address of an existing variable (using '&') to set a pointer variable.
In order to a valid, a pointer has to be set to the address of the variable as the same variable type as a pointer.
That original variable has to be without an asterisk

e.g: 
	int a = 3;
	int *pointer = NULL;
	*pointer = a;

**Dereferencing** only applies to pointers. It means using the '*' operator to retrieve the value 
from the memory address that is pointed to by the pointer.

To access a memory address of a variable at all times, use the reference '&' operator!
