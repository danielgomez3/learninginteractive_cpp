# Overview

In this project I demonstrate the basics of Classes, their constructors, and object instatiation in order to gain a solid understanding of the C++ programming language    


The Software I wrote opens and reads textfiles to the terminal/console interface to instruct the user on questions such as dereferencing, singletons, and the 'static' keyword.   

The purpose for writing this software was to figuratively 'open the gate' to becoming a more C++-oriented programmer and diverge my coding beyond the scope of Python. I have a great fascination and appreciation for the C++ programming language, and I seek to do things the 'right way' vs what others may seek being as an easier way.   
By programming in C++ I have learned universal terminology that other programming languages such as Python tend to hide from sight.

##### Development enviromnment
* Written in the C++ Programming language   
* configured Vim text editor as an IDE  


# Useful Websites
most text and learning were provided from articles from w3 schools and GeeksforGeeks:

* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/CPP/default.asp)   
* [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/)  

# Future Work

* Make sure to optimize Classes and perform task without arbitrary code   
* Ability to save data and read from C++ maps   
* Incorperate a write to file
