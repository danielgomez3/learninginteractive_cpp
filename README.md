# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

In this project I am learning the basics of Classes, their constructors, and object instatiation in order to gain a solid understanding of the C++ programming language  


{Provide a description the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}

The Software I wrote opens and reads textfiles to the terminal/console interface to instruct the user on questions such as dereferencing, singletons, and the 'static' keyword.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

The purpose for writing this software was to figuratively 'open the gate' to becoming a more C++-oriented programmer and diverge my coding beyond the scope of Python. I have a great fascination and appreciation for the C++ programming language, and I seek to do things the 'right way' vs what others may seek being as an easier way.
By programming in C++ I have learned universal terminology that other programming languages such as Python tend to hide from sight.
